# NoteTrainer-iPhone
Plays notes from any monophonic instrument on a staff
This was a product for the iPhone 3GS and was released into the App Store way back.
I found that the FFT-based note trackers were not very good at picking the exact pitch, just the note: in other words, a multiple of the base frequency. 
Wavelets, however, gave me a much better result, as least on minimal hardware.
